# valve-tags #

> 3D printable tags for your plumbing valves.

There are several variations of all the labels I could think of that
you might need, and they come in several styles of tags:

* `corner-slots-only` has slots at the corners for putting a zip-tie
  through and around the pipe to label it.
* `end-slots-only` has slots at each end for zip-ties to attach it to
  the pipe or the valve.
* `all-slots` has both corner and ends slots.
* `left-end-hole-only` has just a single hole for hanging.
* `slots-and-holes` has slots at the corners and holes at each end.

The valve-tag.scad file works with the OpenSCAD Customizer, in case
you need tags that I didn't think of.
